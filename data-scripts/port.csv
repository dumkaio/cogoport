A food sanitary registry is required for processed food products (issued by DIGESA’s Food and Environmental Health Bureau or a Sanitary Certificate for animal, plants, or their by-products issued by SENASA). Goods can be brought into the country and kept in a bonded warehouse without paying import duties for up to twelve months. During that period, the importer can pay the duties on the goods kept in the warehouse and clear customs, or re-export the goods. This can be done for the entire shipment, or it can be broken down according to the importer’s needs.

For food and beverages, the importer must submit a sworn application to DIGESA accompanied by a Certificate of Free Trade and Use issued by the health authority of the country of origin, the future label, and the registration receipt. If the certificate is not available, the importer should present a document issued by the Peruvian Consulate in the country of origin. The sworn application includes the contact information of the importer’s company and the manufacturer, taxpayer’s identification (RUC), the list of products requested and for each product its content, the results of physical-chemical and microbiological analysis, lot code system, expiration date, packaging material and storage conditions.

Before reaching the point of sale, imported packaged foods must carry a separate adhesive label with a Spanish translation, including the importer/distributor’s contact information and RUC (taxpayer number). Law 28405 (November 30, 2004) requires labeling for value-added products other than foods. ","

Ten data elements are to be submitted by importers or their agents by a yet to be determined system.  Among the options being discussed are the AMS [Automated Manifest System], and ABI [Automated Broker Interface – a U.S. Customs Broker clearance system].

The following 10 data elements were selected because of their probative value and because of their ready availability in current logistics processes. They include: 

Manufacturer name and address
Seller name and address
Container stuffing location
Consolidator name and address
Buyer name and address
“Ship to” name and address
Importer of record number
Consignee number

U.S Customs & Border Protection “10 + 2 Initiative”

In addition to the current data elements specified under the 24-Hour Rule, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposes to require an additional set of data elements 24 hours prior to vessel loading.

Ten data elements are to be submitted by importers or their agents by a yet to be determined system.  Among the options being discussed are the AMS [Automated Manifest System], and ABI [Automated Broker Interface – a U.S. Customs Broker clearance system].

The following 10 data elements were selected because of their probative value and because of their ready availability in current logistics processes. They include: 

Manufacturer name and address
Seller name and address
Container stuffing location
Consolidator name and address
Buyer name and address
“Ship to” name and address
Importer of record number
Consignee number
Country of origin of the goods
Commodity Harmonized Tariff Schedule number
In addition to the data elements outlined above, CBP will require ocean carriers to provide two additional data sets to complete the security filing:

Vessel Stow Plan

Provided to U.S. Customs by the vessel operator after vessel leaves the last foreign port, before it arrives in U.S. This will allow CBP to check each container stowed on the vessel against the containers which have been manifested to meet the 24 hour rule to ensure all cargo has been reported.

U.S Customs & Border Protection “10 + 2 Initiative”

In addition to the current data elements specified under the 24-Hour Rule, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposes to require an additional set of data elements 24 hours prior to vessel loading.

Ten data elements are to be submitted by importers or their agents by a yet to be determined system.  Among the options being discussed are the AMS [Automated Manifest System], and ABI [Automated Broker Interface – a U.S. Customs Broker clearance system].

The following 10 data elements were selected because of their probative value and because of their ready availability in current logistics processes. They include: 

Manufacturer name and address
Seller name and address
Container stuffing location
Consolidator name and address
Buyer name and address
“Ship to” name and address
Importer of record number
Consignee number
Country of origin of the goods
Commodity Harmonized Tariff Schedule number
In addition to the data elements outlined above, CBP will require ocean carriers to provide two additional data sets to complete the security filing:

Vessel Stow Plan

Provided to U.S. Customs by the vessel operator after vessel leaves the last foreign port, before it arrives in U.S. This will allow CBP to check each container stowed on the vessel against the containers which have been manifested to meet the 24 hour rule to ensure all cargo has been reported.

U.S Customs & Border Protection “10 + 2 Initiative”

In addition to the current data elements specified under the 24-Hour Rule, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposes to require an additional set of data elements 24 hours prior to vessel loading.

Ten data elements are to be submitted by importers or their agents by a yet to be determined system.  Among the options being discussed are the AMS [Automated Manifest System], and ABI [Automated Broker Interface – a U.S. Customs Broker clearance system].

The following 10 data elements were selected because of their probative value and because of their ready availability in current logistics processes. They include: 

Manufacturer name and address
Seller name and address
Container stuffing location
Consolidator name and address
Buyer name and address
“Ship to” name and address
Importer of record number
Consignee number
Country of origin of the goods
Commodity Harmonized Tariff Schedule number
In addition to the data elements outlined above, CBP will require ocean carriers to provide two additional data sets to complete the security filing:

Vessel Stow Plan

Provided to U.S. Customs by the vessel operator after vessel leaves the last foreign port, before it arrives in U.S. This will allow CBP to check each container stowed on the vessel against the containers which have been manifested to meet the 24 hour rule to ensure all cargo has been reported.

U.S Customs & Border Protection “10 + 2 Initiative”

In addition to the current data elements specified under the 24-Hour Rule, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposes to require an additional set of data elements 24 hours prior to vessel loading.

Ten data elements are to be submitted by importers or their agents by a yet to be determined system.  Among the options being discussed are the AMS [Automated Manifest System], and ABI [Automated Broker Interface – a U.S. Customs Broker clearance system].

The following 10 data elements were selected because of their probative value and because of their ready availability in current logistics processes. They include: 

Manufacturer name and address
Seller name and address
Container stuffing location
Consolidator name and address
Buyer name and address
“Ship to” name and address
Importer of record number
Consignee number
Country of origin of the goods
Commodity Harmonized Tariff Schedule number
In addition to the data elements outlined above, CBP will require ocean carriers to provide two additional data sets to complete the security filing:

Vessel Stow Plan

Provided to U.S. Customs by the vessel operator after vessel leaves the last foreign port, before it arrives in U.S. This will allow CBP to check each container stowed on the vessel against the containers which have been manifested to meet the 24 hour rule to ensure all cargo has been reported.

U.S Customs & Border Protection “10 + 2 Initiative”

In addition to the current data elements specified under the 24-Hour Rule, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposes to require an additional set of data elements 24 hours prior to vessel loading.

Ten data elements are to be submitted by importers or their agents by a yet to be determined system.  Among the options being discussed are the AMS [Automated Manifest System], and ABI [Automated Broker Interface – a U.S. Customs Broker clearance system].

The following 10 data elements were selected because of their probative value and because of their ready availability in current logistics processes. They include: 

Manufacturer name and address
Seller name and address
Container stuffing location
Consolidator name and address
Buyer name and address
“Ship to” name and address
Importer of record number
Consignee number
Country of origin of the goods
Commodity Harmonized Tariff Schedule number
In addition to the data elements outlined above, CBP will require ocean carriers to provide two additional data sets to complete the security filing:

Vessel Stow Plan

Provided to U.S. Customs by the vessel operator after vessel leaves the last foreign port, before it arrives in U.S. This will allow CBP to check each container stowed on the vessel against the containers which have been manifested to meet the 24 hour rule to ensure all cargo has been reported.

Required documents are: commercial invoice, transportation document, and certificate of origin.  However, the country may require other certificates depending on the type of product (HS Code).

It is also important to mention that re-exporting within a Mercosur member country does not give rise to an exemption from custom duties: For instance, if you export a product to Uruguay, and sell it to Brazil later, you would have to pay Uruguayan customs fees, and later Brazilian customs fees.

In addition to the current data elements specified under the 24-Hour Rule, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposes to require an additional set of data elements 24 hours prior to vessel loading.

Ten data elements are to be submitted by importers or their agents by a yet to be determined system.  Among the options being discussed are the AMS [Automated Manifest System], and ABI [Automated Broker Interface – a U.S. Customs Broker clearance system].

The following 10 data elements were selected because of their probative value and because of their ready availability in current logistics processes. They include: 

Manufacturer name and address
Seller name and address
Container stuffing location
Consolidator name and address
Buyer name and address
“Ship to” name and address
Importer of record number
Consignee number
Country of origin of the goods
Commodity Harmonized Tariff Schedule number
In addition to the data elements outlined above, CBP will require ocean carriers to provide two additional data sets to complete the security filing:

Vessel Stow Plan

Provided to U.S. Customs by the vessel operator after vessel leaves the last foreign port, before it arrives in U.S. This will allow CBP to check each container stowed on the vessel against the containers which have been manifested to meet the 24 hour rule to ensure all cargo has been reported.

Container Status Messages
Container Status Messages (CSM’s)

Container movements from the time a container is associated with a U.S. booking, until container gates out for delivery.

A food sanitary registry is required for processed food products (issued by DIGESA’s Food and Environmental Health Bureau or a Sanitary Certificate for animal, plants, or their by-products issued by SENASA). Goods can be brought into the country and kept in a bonded warehouse without paying import duties for up to twelve months. During that period, the importer can pay the duties on the goods kept in the warehouse and clear customs, or re-export the goods. This can be done for the entire shipment, or it can be broken down according to the importer’s needs.

For food and beverages, the importer must submit a sworn application to DIGESA accompanied by a Certificate of Free Trade and Use issued by the health authority of the country of origin, the future label, and the registration receipt. If the certificate is not available, the importer should present a document issued by the Peruvian Consulate in the country of origin. The sworn application includes the contact information of the importer’s company and the manufacturer, taxpayer’s identification (RUC), the list of products requested and for each product its content, the results of physical-chemical and microbiological analysis, lot code system, expiration date, packaging material and storage conditions.

Before reaching the point of sale, imported packaged foods must carry a separate adhesive label with a Spanish translation, including the importer/distributor’s contact information and RUC (taxpayer number).
